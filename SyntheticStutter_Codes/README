# SyntheticStutter

**SyntheticStutter** is a MATLAB-based simulation platform for modeling speech disfluency—particularly stuttering and cluttering—using principles from predictive processing and active inference. The framework operationalizes a two-level generative model of speech production and allows users to simulate, visualize, and test how precision-weighted prediction errors affect fluent articulation.

## Overview

Speech production is modeled as a hierarchical inference process, where a high-level cognitive-linguistic intention (`x₁`) generates predictions about low-level articulatory-motor states (`x₂`) and sensory outcomes (auditory and somatosensory). Variational free energy is minimized via gradient descent on prediction errors, and disfluencies (e.g., blocks, repetitions, or rapid speech) emerge from imbalanced precision dynamics.

The platform includes:
- An interactive GUI (`SyntheticStutter.m`)
- A batch testing tool (`SyntheticStutter_BatchAnalysis.m`)
- A family of hypothesis-driven simulation scripts
- Integration with natural speech passages and predictability annotations

## Features

- Simulates stuttering and cluttering from a unified computational framework
- Supports word-level predictability input from the Provo Corpus
- Visualizes prediction error, motor freezing, free energy dynamics, and uncertainty
- GUI controls for attention, sensory precision, rate, noise, and planning horizon
- Hypothesis-driven tests: rate, attention, precision×rate, planning, repetition, and predictability
- Batch analysis across multiple utterances
- Free energy gradient visualization and causal loop exploration tools
